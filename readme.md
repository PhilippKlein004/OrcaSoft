This application was coded during the fourth semester in the subject of Software Engineering II. My professor gave my team the task of building a job marketplace like StepStone, Indeed, etc.

The application is built on the Java framework, Vaadin. Our professor gave us a pre-build application that was made for managing and viewing cars. And that is what we came up with:

[Login and Registration](#login-and-registration)<br>
[Search for Jobs](#search-for-jobs)<br>
[Profile and Job offer settings](#profile-and-job-offer-settings)<br>
[Job applications](#job-applications)<br>

### Login and Registration

Other teams used the UI and logic of the software and built on top of it. We've chosen to wipe it completely (except the connection class for the database) and build our own UI and logic.

### Search for Jobs

As you can see, while you type, you get suggestions that you can select with the cursor. When ENTER is pressed, you'll see the results if available.

### Profile and Job offer settings

When you're logged in as a company, you'll see the regular data as well as your current vacancies on the left side. As a student, you'll see your regular data as well with your applications on the left side.

### Job applications

A student, who wants to apply for a job offer, needs to first have the necessary skills to, send an application. You'll see this either via the notice at the top of the screen or by the fact that the apply button is deactivated on the search view.
